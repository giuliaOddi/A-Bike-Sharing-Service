# A-Bike-Sharing-Service
The goal of the project was the realization of a **bike sharing** service simulation. In this simulation, cyclists shall be able to rent a bike from a single *Docking Station* and each smart bike is controlled by an on-board embedded CPU. 

The exchange schema adopted for representing the information to be sent through CoAP POST requests is the *JSON* format. The realized system is composed by 2 CoAP servers and 2 CoAP clients:

**Clients**:
- Cyclist Client
- Manager Client

**Servers**:
- Docking Station Server
- Bike CPU Server
